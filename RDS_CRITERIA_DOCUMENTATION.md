# RDS (Restructuring Difficulty Score) Criteria Documentation

## Overview

The RDS (Restructuring Difficulty Score) is a proprietary **AI-powered 10-criteria risk assessment system** designed to identify companies at high risk of financial distress, with particular focus on private equity (PE) and leveraged buyout (LBO) scenarios. The scoring system ranges from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater restructuring risk (includes integrated debt structure analysis).

## 🧠 Advanced AI-Powered Scoring Philosophy

**Revolutionary AI System**: The RDS now incorporates sophisticated artificial intelligence that goes far beyond basic financial ratios to detect subtle patterns, correlations, and risk signals that standard analysis would miss.

**Key AI Capabilities**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects behavioral patterns, trend trajectories, and complex risk correlations
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses historical patterns to predict future risk trajectories
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Considers market conditions, industry trends, and regulatory environment
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Recognizes PE sponsor patterns and LP pressure dynamics
- **Multi-Factor Correlation**: Integrates complex relationships between risk factors
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjusts scoring based on changing market conditions
- **Volatility Assessment**: Analyzes stability patterns across multiple metrics
- **Professional-Grade Analysis**: Matches institutional risk assessment capabilities

**Scoring Principles**:
- Each criterion incorporates multiple AI-powered sub-factors
- Partial points are assigned based on sophisticated risk assessment
- No binary scoring - nuanced analysis captures risk complexity
- Total RDS score reflects comprehensive AI analysis
- Only companies with multiple extreme risk factors reach maximum scores
